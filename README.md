# Paiir
Paiir is an iOS App developed in 2014, written in Objective-C. We wanted to develop a simple photo-sharing app where two people can create one photo together. The result is an app where one user contributes the top half of a photo and another user contributes the lower half of the photo. The two halves are then stitched together to create a Paiir.

After launch in 2015 it was featured in the App Store in over 100 countries.

This repo might be a bit unorganized since I just did a quick dump of all the files. Feel free to sift through the code if you want, and you're free to use the code as well.

**Update: We've taken the app from the App Store.
